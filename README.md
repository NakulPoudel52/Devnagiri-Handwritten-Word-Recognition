# Devnagiri-Handwritten-Word-Recognition
Handwriting Recognition is the mechanism for converting the handwritten text into machine-encoded text. 
## Abstract
Handwritten Text Recognition is one of the most challenging and demanding areas
of interest for researchers in domains of pattern recognition and image processing.
All these advancements have been possible because of the introduction of concepts
like artificial intelligence(AI) and deep learning. Deep Neural Networks have
proven to be the best choice when it comes to a task involving recognition. Many
researchers have worked with recognition of characters of different languages but
there is comparatively less work carried out for Devanagari Script. Recognition of
fused characters is also a major concern for researchers as fused character is treated
as a single character resulting in an error. In this paper, we propose development
of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based Optical Character
Recognition System (OCR) for Handwritten Devanagari Script which is observed
to recognize the characters, words accurately.
